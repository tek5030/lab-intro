# Introduction to Python and OpenCV
We will in this first lab start playing around with Python and images
by capturing video and processing it in real time using OpenCV.

The lab is carried out by following these steps:
1. [Open the project in PyCharm](lab-guide/1-open-project-in-pycharm.md)
2. [Acquire and display live video](lab-guide/2-acquire-and-display-live-video.md)
3. [Process the live video stream](lab-guide/3-processing-live-video.md)

Please start the lab by going to the [first step](lab-guide/1-open-project-in-pycharm.md).
