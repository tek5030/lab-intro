# Lab 0: Introduction to C++ and OpenCV
We will in this first lab start playing around with C++ and images
by capturing video and processing it in real time using OpenCV.

The lab is carried out by following these steps:
1. [Open the project in CLion](lab-guide/1-open-project-in-clion.md)
2. [Acquire and display live video](lab-guide/2-acquire-and-display-live-video.md)
3. [Process the live video stream](lab-guide/3-processing-live-video.md)

Please start the lab by going to the [first step](lab-guide/1-open-project-in-clion.md).
